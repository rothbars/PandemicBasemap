# MapBox Basemap Inspired by the Pandemic™ Boardgame

This MapBox style was inspired by the boardgame Pandemic™ with a primarily blue and yellow color scheme. In this case the land masses are colored in various shades of blue while the roadways which connect major cities are colored yellow. This color scheme also matches the same scheme used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in some of their infectious disease PowerPoint© presentations. I was inspired to create a map using this color scheme because of how much I have enjoyed playing the boardgame and how relevant the premise of the game is to the field of infectious disease. Because the main outcome of interest in my research are foodborne Salmonella infections I thought this theme was especially appropriate. The map can be seen [here](https://rothbars.github.io/PandemicBasemap/).

The font titled "Visitor1" used to label locations on the map is an equivalent style of text used for labels in the game. Also, I chose to add different markers for cities of different sizes. These SVG images depict different cartoon images of bacteria and viruses which replace the point icons for cities. These SVG images were provided created by those at https://www.freepik.com and licensed by those at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0. This MapBox map was created from the 'Lè Shine' basemap because I thought its minimalistic approach was a good canvas for me to present my Salmonella data on.
